# Contelia

Application able to read books from a Lunii story teller (format v1) and
[STUdio - Story Teller Unleashed][STUdio] (story.json).

It's dedicated to the [Carnotzet OS][Carnotzet] for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
Everything is still a work in progress.

The books can be copied/pasted from the Lunii or STUdio without conversions.
Contelia implements the necessary readers.
